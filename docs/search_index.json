They most commonly used are; strings, numerics(integers and floats) and boolean values. The function class can be used to find the data type. Try it! Before diving deep into data types, lets create a value with a random value for instance age and finds its data type. age &lt;- 27 class(age) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; The age is a \"numeric\" data type variable, interesting? Lets explore different data types and their examples; Integers: These are whole numbers without dev=cimal point(e.g., 10, -5). In R, it is specified with the L suffix like 10L. Floats: These are numbers with decimal points(e.g. 3.14, -2.718). R refers them as numerics. Boolean(Logical): True or False values, represented as TRUE or FALSE in R. They are crucial in conditional statements. Strings(Character): These are text values enclosed in quotes(e.g. \"Hello world\" , names like \"John\", \"Mustafa\", \"Patel\", variable names like \"age\", \"gender\", \"salary\") You will often deal with mixed data types when analyzing real-world data sets therefore understanding these will help you handles any data set! Examples Lets have some fun! We will create different variables and find their data types; age &lt;- 34L age &lt;- 34L class(age) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; weight &lt;- 68.2 weight &lt;- 68.2 class(weight) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; name &lt;- \"Mustafa\" name &lt;- &quot;Mustafa&quot; class(name) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; is_winter &lt;- FALSE is_winter &lt;- FALSE class(is_winter) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; You see how simple it is to find the data type of different variables in R! Remember the class function returns any number whether with decimal or whole as \"numeric\". It only returns \"integer\" when there is a suffix L. Practical Exercise Try out the practical exercise below to test your understanding in data types Find the data type of 98.03 using class() function. Assign the value 98.03 to variable height and find data type of height. There are 27 goats in a field, assign the quantity of goats to a variable goats and find the data type of the variable goats. Remember to add suffix L to the value 27. Find the data type of the value \"school\" using the class() function. Assign your first name to a variable firstname and find its data type. Remember to enclose it in quotation marks Create a variable is_student and assign it the value TRUE. Use the class() function to find its data type. Solution Find the data type of 98.03 using class() function. class(98.03) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Assign the value 98.03 to variable height and find data type of height. height &lt;- 98.03 class(height) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; There are 27 goats in a field, assign the quantity of goats to a variable goats and find the data type of the variable goats. Remember to add suffix L to the value 27. goats &lt;- 27L class(goats) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Find the data type of the value \"school\" using the class() function. class(&quot;school&quot;) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Assign your first name to a variable firstname and find its data type. Remember to enclose it in quotation marks firstname &lt;- &quot;Bryant&quot; # Any name will work class(firstname) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Create a variable is_student and assign it the value TRUE. Use the class() function to find its data type. is_student &lt;- TRUE class(is_student) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; ________________________________________________________________________________ 1.1.2 Data Structures This is the organization of data into or multiple data values in specific structures, they include vectors, matrix and data frames. Lets explore the mentioned data structures and their examples; Vector: This is a sequence of elements of the same data types(e.g., `c(1, 2, 3) is a numeric vector) Matrix: This is a two-dimensional data structure with rows and columns, where all elements are of the same type(e.g. numbers). Data Frames: This is the most common R data structure for handling tabular data(like an excel sheet). A data frame can contain different data types in each column unlike matrices and vectors. Data frames are central to real-world data analysis. You will work with them to analyze, transform, and visualize data sets, whether you are calculating averages or identifying trends. The is.vector, is.matrix and is.data.frame functions are used to confirm if the variable in question is a vector, matrix or data frame respectively. Examples Lets have some fun! We will create different data structures and find their data types: Create a vector, marks to store the values, 23, 67, 98, 34, 98, 21. Print the vector to the console and use is.vector function to confirm if its a actually a vector. marks = c(23, 67, 98, 34, 98, 21) print(marks) # print to the console ## [1] 23 67 98 34 98 21 is.vector(marks) # find its data structure ## [1] TRUE Create a matrix with values from 1 to 9 and use the is.matrix function to find to confirm if its really a matrix. vector1 = seq(1, 9) # Convert to matrix ## create by column m1=matrix(vector1, ncol=3) print(m1) # print the matrix to the console ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 is.matrix(m1) # confirms if its really a matrix ## [1] TRUE Create a data.frame from the above matrix. Add the column names as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\". Confirm if its really a matrix. var_names &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) # vector to store variable names m1_df &lt;- data.frame(var_names, m1) # create the data frame print(m1_df) #print to the console ## var_names X1 X2 X3 ## 1 A 1 4 7 ## 2 B 2 5 8 ## 3 C 3 6 9 is.data.frame(m1_df) #confirms if its really a data.frame. ## [1] TRUE Practical Exercise Try out the exercise below to test your understanding in R data structures; Create a vector named height with the values 120.1, 118, 123.4, 130.8, 115.2. Use the is.vector to confirm that the created variable is a vector. Use length() function to count the number of elements in the vector. Create a matrix m1 from the vector v1 where v1 &lt;- seq(1, 12) with three columns. Use the is.matrix function to confirm if the said variable is a matrix. Access the third column by running the command m1[, 3]. Access the second row by running the command m1[2,]. Create a data frame students_df with the columns \"Name\", \"Age\", and \"Marks\" for three students. Where Name &lt;- c(\"Pragya\", \"Thomas\", \"Ali\"), Age &lt;- c(21, 19, 23) and Marks &lt;- c(68, 72, 67). Solution Create a vector named height with the values 120.1, 118, 123.4, 130.8, 115.2. Use the is.vector to confirm that the created variable is a vector. height &lt;- c(120.1, 118, 123.4, 130.8, 115.2) is.vector(height) ## [1] TRUE Use length() function to count the number of elements in the vector. length(height) # count the number of elements ## [1] 5 Create a matrix m1 from the vector v1 where v1 &lt;- seq(1, 12) with three columns. Use the is.matrix function to confirm if the said variable is a matrix. v1 &lt;- seq(1, 12) # Create vector v1 m1 &lt;- matrix(v1, ncol=3) # create a matrix from the vector m1 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 5 9 ## [2,] 2 6 10 ## [3,] 3 7 11 ## [4,] 4 8 12 is.matrix(m1) # Confirm if its a matrix ## [1] TRUE Access the third column by running the command m1[, 3]. m1[, 3] # Access the third columns ## [1] 9 10 11 12 Access the second row by running the command m1[2,]. m1[2,] # Access of the second row ## [1] 2 6 10 Create a data frame students_df with the columns \"Name\", \"Age\", and \"Marks\" for three students. Where Name &lt;- c(\"Pragya\", \"Thomas\", \"Ali\"), Age &lt;- c(21, 19, 23) and Marks &lt;- c(68, 72, 67). student_df &lt;- data.frame( &quot;Name&quot;= c(&quot;Pragya&quot;, &quot;Thomas&quot;, &quot;Ali&quot;), &quot;Age&quot;=c(21, 19, 23), &quot;Marks&quot;=c(68, 72, 67) ) student_df ## Name Age Marks ## 1 Pragya 21 68 ## 2 Thomas 19 72 ## 3 Ali 23 67 ________________________________________________________________________________ 1.2 Data Importing and Exporting Importing and exporting data is the foundation of data analysis workflows. The main two types of data files used are CSV and excel files. CSV Files: R can easily import CSV files using read.csv(\"filename.csv\"). The CSV is one of the most common formats you will encounter. Excel Files: For excel files, you can use the readxl package with the function read_excel. Try it: Let’s have some fun by importing; From CSV file m1_imported &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/m1.csv&quot;) # import the csv data set m1_imported # Display the data ## X V1 V2 V3 ## 1 1 1 5 9 ## 2 2 2 6 10 ## 3 3 3 7 11 ## 4 4 4 8 12 From Excel file library(readxl) students_imported &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/students.xlsx&quot;) # Import the data students_imported # Display the data ## # A tibble: 3 × 3 ## Name Age Marks ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Pragya 21 68 ## 2 Thomas 19 72 ## 3 Ali 23 67 After data wrangling, manipulation and processing, the end product(processed data) can be saved for further use. The data can also be shared to others. Lets explore how export the CSV and Excel files To CSV: You can save your data to CSV format using write.csv(data, \"filepath.csv\"). To Excel To write to Excel, you can use write.xlsx(data, \"filepath.xlsx\") from the openxlsx package. Try it: Lets export the previously imported data set locally To CSV write.csv(m1_imported, &quot;data/m1_exported.csv&quot;) # Write the data set locally Excel File library(openxlsx) write.xlsx(students_imported, &quot;data/students_exported.xlsx&quot;) Practical Exercise 1.3 Data Cleaning Before you analyze data, it is crucial to ensure that it is clean. Here are some common issues in data cleaning; Null Values: Missing data can distort your analysis. Functions like is.na() and na.omit() are used to detect and remove null values respectively. Null values can also be imputed by filling the missing values with the most relevant value for instance mean, mode or median of the variable, zero, or any dedicated value. Duplicated Records: Duplicates can cause bias in results and they can detected using the duplicated() function. This duplicated records can be removed by unique() function from R or distinct() from dplyr package. Outliers: These are extreme values that don’t follow the general trend. The use of summary statistics(specifically IQR) and boxplots can be used to cap these values based on the context. Data cleaning is like polishing a diamond-it ensures the data is ready for analysis, free from distortions like missing values or outliers that can skew your insights. Try it: Lets have some fan! We will create a random data set, identify all data issues and address them by cleaning. Create a sample data set # Create a dataset set.seed(42) df &lt;- data.frame( Product = c(&#39;Shoes&#39;, &#39;Laptop&#39;, &#39;Watch&#39;, &#39;Phone&#39;, &#39;Shoes&#39;, &#39;Watch&#39;, &#39;Laptop&#39;, &#39;Shoes&#39;, &#39;Laptop&#39;, &#39;Phone&#39;), Sales = c(150, 500, NA, 300, 150, 1000, 500, 150, 500, 300), # Outlier in Sales (1000) Category = c(&#39;Fashion&#39;, &#39;Tech&#39;, &#39;Fashion&#39;, &#39;Tech&#39;, &#39;Fashion&#39;, &#39;Fashion&#39;, &#39;Tech&#39;, &#39;Fashion&#39;, &#39;Tech&#39;, &#39;Tech&#39;), Discount = c(10, 0, 20, 5, 10, 20, 0, 10, 0, 5), Returns = c(2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0), Profit = c(30, 100, NA, 70, 30, 500, 100, 30, 100, 70) # Outlier in Profit (500) ) # Add duplicated rows df &lt;- rbind(df, df[2:3, ]) # View the dataset head(df) ## Product Sales Category Discount Returns Profit ## 1 Shoes 150 Fashion 10 2 30 ## 2 Laptop 500 Tech 0 0 100 ## 3 Watch NA Fashion 20 1 NA ## 4 Phone 300 Tech 5 0 70 ## 5 Shoes 150 Fashion 10 2 30 ## 6 Watch 1000 Fashion 20 1 500 Count the null values sum(is.na(df)) ## [1] 4 There are 4 null values in the data set. Let’s handle the null values by filling them with mean of the respective variables. # Fill missing Sales and Profit with the mean of the respective columns df$Sales[is.na(df$Sales)] &lt;- mean(df$Sales, na.rm = TRUE) df$Profit[is.na(df$Profit)] &lt;- mean(df$Profit, na.rm = TRUE) # View the data set after handling null values head(df) ## Product Sales Category Discount Returns Profit ## 1 Shoes 150 Fashion 10 2 30 ## 2 Laptop 500 Tech 0 0 100 ## 3 Watch 405 Fashion 20 1 113 ## 4 Phone 300 Tech 5 0 70 ## 5 Shoes 150 Fashion 10 2 30 ## 6 Watch 1000 Fashion 20 1 500 # Count the null values in the data set to confirm the operation sum(is.na(df)) ## [1] 0 The null values are now filled and the data set is complete. Let’s find if there exists some duplicated records and how many are they? # Count the duplicated rows sum(duplicated(df)) ## [1] 7 # Shape of the data set dim(df) ## [1] 12 6 There are 7 duplicated rows. We will remove the duplicated records and retain only one row of the same kind. This can be achieved using unique() from base R or distinct() from dplyr package. In this case we will be using the distinct command. # Load the required libraries library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union # Remove duplicated rows df_cleaned &lt;- df %&gt;% distinct() # Count the duplicated records sum(duplicated(df_cleaned)) ## [1] 0 # Shape of the data set dim(df_cleaned) ## [1] 5 6 The data has no duplicated records and it is evident that 7 records(duplicated) were deleted. They are only 5 rows remaining. The last step of data cleaning in this case is to identify outliers in the Sales and Profit, and remove them using the IQR method. # Use the IQR method to detect outliers in Sales and Profit Q1_sales &lt;- quantile(df_cleaned$Sales, 0.25) Q3_sales &lt;- quantile(df_cleaned$Sales, 0.75) IQR_sales &lt;- Q3_sales - Q1_sales Q1_profit &lt;- quantile(df_cleaned$Profit, 0.25) Q3_profit &lt;- quantile(df_cleaned$Profit, 0.75) IQR_profit &lt;- Q3_profit - Q1_profit # Filter out outliers df_cleaned &lt;- df_cleaned %&gt;% filter(!(Sales &lt; (Q1_sales - 1.5 * IQR_sales) | Sales &gt; (Q3_sales + 1.5 * IQR_sales))) %&gt;% filter(!(Profit &lt; (Q1_profit - 1.5 * IQR_profit) | Profit &gt; (Q3_profit + 1.5 * IQR_profit))) # Find out how many records were affected dim(df_cleaned) ## [1] 4 6 Only one row had outliers and was removed. The data is now clean and ready for further analysis. Practical Exercise Solution ________________________________________________________________________________ 1.4 Data Visualization **____What is Data Visualization____** ggplot is one of the most popular and flexble data visualization libraries in R. It follows the grammar of graphics philosophy, allowing you o build plots in layers. Here are some of the basic plots in data visualization; Scatter Plots: used to visualize the relationship between two variables in R. Bar Charts: used to compare categorical data. Histograms: used to represent distribution of a single continuous variable. Visualizations are powerful tools that help you see patterns and insights that raw data might hide. A well-made plot can communicate your findings more effectively than numbers alone. Try it: Lets use the above data set that we cleaned to plot simple charts in R using ggplot library. Install the package if not installed install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Load the library library(ggplot2) 1.5 Hands-on Exercises Solution ________________________________________________________________________________ "],["functions.html", "Chapter 2 Functions 2.1 Writing Functions 2.2 Calling the Functions 2.3 Function Documentation 2.4 Hands-on Exercise", " Chapter 2 Functions In programming, functions are like little blocks of code that perform a specific task. Think of them as reusable instructions that you can call whenever you need them. Here’s why functions are super helpful: Avoid repetition: Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can just call the function. Cleaner code: Your code becomes easier to read and maintain because functions help organize it better. Easier debugging: When something goes wrong, you only need to check the function itself rather than searching through your entire program. Why Use Functions? Imagine having to rewrite a set of instructions every time you need them! With functions, you write the code once and reuse it as many times as you want. A good rule of thumb is: if you expect to run a specific set of instructions more than twice, create a function for it. What Can Functions Do? Functions are flexible and can be used for many different purposes: Take input (called arguments) Process the input based on what the function is meant to do Return a result after completing the task 2.1 Writing Functions Lets take a tour on different types of functions in R before diving deep into writing functions. This will help you understand when to write functions and when to use readily-available functions. There are three main types of functions: User-Defined Functions (UDF) – Custom functions you write for your specific needs. Built-in functions – These come pre-loaded in R. Example: mean() Package functions – Functions from external R packages you can install. Example: ggplot() and select() from ggplot2 and dplyr respectively. 2.1.1 User-Defined Functions The best way to grasp how functions work in R is by creating your own! These are called* User-Defined Functions (UDFs), and they allow you to design custom tasks that fit your needs. In R, functions typically follow this format: function_name &lt;- function(argument_1, argument_2) { # Function body (your instructions go here) return(output) } Let’s break down the key elements: Function Name: This is how you’ll call your function later. When you create a function, you assign it a name and save it as a new object. For example, if you name your function calculate_mean, that’s the name you’ll use every time you want to run the function. Arguments (also called Parameters): Arguments are placed inside the parentheses. They tell the function what input to expect or how to modify its behavior. Think of them as placeholders for the data you’ll provide later when you run the function. Function Body: Inside the curly brackets {}, you’ll write the instructions that the function will follow to accomplish the task. This is the “heart” of the function. Return Statement: The return() function tells R what result to give you after the function finishes its job. It’s optional, but it helps if you want to store the function’s result in a variable. Let’s write a simple function that calculates the mean (average) of two numbers: mean_two_numbers &lt;- function(num_1, num_2) { mean &lt;- (num_1 + num_2) / 2 return(mean) } How to Use the Function: To find the mean of 10 and 20, simply call the function like this: mean_two_numbers(10, 20) ## [1] 15 Let’s add a few more simple tasks: writing a function that calculates the difference between two numbers. Why is this important? Well, imagine you have two values and you want to find their difference—that’s exactly what this function will help us do! # Function to calculate the difference between two numbers calculate_difference &lt;- function(x, y) { # Subtract the second number (y) from the first number (x) difference &lt;- x - y # Return the difference result so we can use it later return(difference) } You see!: x and y are our arguments: These are the two numbers we’ll use in our calculation. The subtraction happens inside the function: We simply subtract y from x and store the result in difference. Finally, we return the difference: This way, we can use the result when we call the function. Now, let’s put it to the test! We’ll run the function with different sets of numbers and see what we get: calculate_difference(10, 5) # 10 - 5 = 5 ## [1] 5 calculate_difference(25, 15) # 25 - 15 = 10 ## [1] 10 calculate_difference(50, 30) # 50 - 30 = 20 ## [1] 20 Notice how easy it is to calculate the difference between any two numbers by just calling our function? That’s the power of writing your own functions—they make life a lot easier! Now, lets make it more interesting! How about a function that greets you by name? We can do the same in R by creating a simple function that takes someone’s name and returns a greeting. Here is how we do it: # Function to greet a student by their name greet_student &lt;- function(student_name) { # Create a personalized greeting greeting &lt;- paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, student_name, &quot;!&quot;) # Return the greeting so we can use it later return(greeting) } Remember! We use student_name as the argument: This is where you pass in the name of the student. We combine \"Hello\" with the name: The paste() function(that is an -in-built function which will discuss later in the course) helps us put the pieces together to form a full sentence. Return the greeting: The function gives us back a customized message, ready to greet anyone! Lets try it out with different names greet_student(&quot;John&quot;) # Hello John! ## [1] &quot;Hello John !&quot; greet_student(&quot;Alice&quot;) # Hello Alice! ## [1] &quot;Hello Alice !&quot; greet_student(&quot;Michael&quot;) # Hello Michael! ## [1] &quot;Hello Michael !&quot; Remember to try it out with your name! Key Takeaways: By writing these two simple functions, you’ve already tackled a lot of important concepts in R! You now know: How to create a function. How to pass arguments (inputs/parameters) to a function. How to return a result that you can use later. Practical Exercise In this exercise, you’ll get hands-on practice creating your own functions in R. Follow the instructions below to write functions that perform specific tasks. Remember to test your functions with different input values! Create a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. Write a function named is_even that takes a single argument, num, and returns \"Even\" if the number is even, or \"Odd\" if it’s odd. Create a function called find_max that takes three arguments and returns the largest of the three numbers. Solution Create a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. # Function to calculate the sum of two numbers sum_two_numbers &lt;- function(x, y) { sum &lt;- x + y return(sum) } # Test the function with different values sum_two_numbers(5, 10) # Output: 15 ## [1] 15 sum_two_numbers(20, 30) # Output: 50 ## [1] 50 sum_two_numbers(100, 200) # Output: 300 ## [1] 300 Write a function named is_even that takes a single argument, num, and returns \"Even\" if the number is even, or \"Odd\" if it’s odd. # Function to check if a number is even or odd check_even_odd &lt;- function(number) { if (number %% 2 == 0) { return(&quot;Even&quot;) } else { return(&quot;Odd&quot;) } } # Test the function with different numbers check_even_odd(4) # Output: &quot;Even&quot; ## [1] &quot;Even&quot; check_even_odd(7) # Output: &quot;Odd&quot; ## [1] &quot;Odd&quot; check_even_odd(10) # Output: &quot;Even&quot; ## [1] &quot;Even&quot; Create a function called find_max that takes three arguments and returns the largest of the three numbers. # Function to find the maximum of three numbers max_of_three &lt;- function(a, b, c) { max_value &lt;- max(a, b, c) # Use the built-in max function return(max_value) # Return the maximum value } # Test the function with different values max_of_three(10, 20, 5) # Output: 20 ## [1] 20 max_of_three(3, 1, 2) # Output: 3 ## [1] 3 max_of_three(7, 15, 12) # Output: 15 ## [1] 15 ________________________________________________________________________________ 2.1.2 Built-in Fuctions We have learned how to create our own user-defined functions (UDFs) to perform specific tasks. Now, let’s dive deeper into R’s capabilities by exploring its built-in functions. These handy tools are readily available for you to use anytime, making your coding experience even smoother. R is packed with a treasure trove of built-in functions that allow you to perform a variety of tasks with just a few simple commands. Whether you’re crunching numbers or analyzing data, these functions are your best friends. Here’s a sneak peek at some of the most useful built-in functions in R: print(): This function displays an R object right on your console. It’s like saying, “Hey, look at this!” print(&quot;Hello Mum&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello Mum&quot; min() and max(): Need to find the smallest or largest number in a bunch? These functions will do just that for a numeric vector. sum(): Want to add up a series of numbers? Use sum() to get the total of a numeric vector. mean(): This function calculates the average of your numbers. Perfect for when you need to find the middle ground! range(): Curious about the minimum and maximum values of your numeric vector? range() has you covered. str(): Want to understand the structure of an R object? str() will give you a clear picture of what’s inside. ncol(): If you’re working with matrices or data frames, this function tells you how many columns you have. length(): This one returns the number of items in an R object, whether it’s a vector, a list, or a matrix. Here’s a quick example to show you how easy it is to use these functions with a vector of numbers: v &lt;- c(1, 3, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7) # Create a vector print(v) # Display the vector ## [1] 1.0 3.0 0.2 1.5 1.7 sum(v) # Calculate the total sum ## [1] 7.4 mean(v) # Find the average ## [1] 1.48 length(v) # Get the number of elements ## [1] 5 As you can see, working with R’s built-in functions is straightforward and super helpful. Start experimenting with these functions and watch how they can simplify your coding experience! Key Takeaways: By completing this exercise, you’ve already tackled several important concepts in R! You now know: How to create a vector and use it for calculations. How to utilize built-in functions like sum(), max(), min(), mean(), and length(). How to derive meaningful statistics from data using R’s built-in capabilities R has a wealth of resources on this topic, and as you gain more experience and knowledge, you’ll uncover even more advanced built-in functions that can simplify your programming tasks. Practical Exercise In this exercise, you are required to create a vector named numbers that contains the following values: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. After creating the vector, you will use various built-in functions to analyze it based on the instructions below; Use the sum() function to calculate the total of the numbers vector. Use the max() function to find the maximum value in the numbers vector. Use the min() function to find the minimum value in the numbers vector. Use the mean() function to calculate the average of the numbers vector. Use the length() function to find out how many elements are in your numbers vector. Solution In this exercise, you are required to create a vector named numbers that contains the following values: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. After creating the vector, you will use various built-in functions to analyze it based on the instructions below; # Create a vector numbers &lt;- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) Use the sum() function to calculate the total of the numbers vector. sum(numbers) ## [1] 108 Use the max() function to find the maximum value in the numbers vector. max(numbers) ## [1] 42 Use the min() function to find the minimum value in the numbers vector. min(numbers) ## [1] 4 Use the mean() function to calculate the average of the numbers vector. mean(numbers) ## [1] 18 Use the length() function to find out how many elements are in your numbers vector. length(numbers) ## [1] 6 ________________________________________________________________________________ 2.1.3 Package Functions Just like we’ve learned about User-Defined and Built-in Functions, R also provides a vast number of additional functions through packages. These packages extend R’s capabilities and allow you to perform specific tasks, from data manipulation to machine learning, with ease. What are R Package Functions? Packages in R are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code that are stored in a well-defined format. While R comes with a set of built-in functions, packages allow you to go beyond the basic functionality. You can install and load packages based on the task you want to accomplish. Think of package functions as tools in a toolbox: not everything is built-in, but by adding specific tools, you can perform new tasks easily. Lets explore how to get started using the functions; Installing and Loading Packages To use functions from a package, you first need to install the package and load it into your R session. install.packages(&quot;package_name&quot;) Every time you start a new R session if you want to use the functions from that package. Load the package by; library(package_name) To put this into real-life action, let’s learn about the dplyr package, which is commonly used for data manipulation. It contains many useful functions to work with data frames or tibbles (a modern version of data frames). Here’s an example of how to install and load dplyr, and use some of its core functions. Install the package install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) # Install it once Load the package library(dplyr) # Load it whenever you need to use it Let’s explore a few package functions from dplyr: select(): Chooses specific columns from a dataset. filter(): Filters rows based on conditions. mutate(): Adds new variables (columns) or modifies existing ones. summarise(): Summarizes data, such as calculating the mean or total We will create a data frame to demonstrate how to use functions from the dplyr package. # Create a data frame for demonstration data &lt;- data.frame( Name = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;), Age = c(28, 34, 22, 19), Score = c(85, 90, 88, 92) ) # 1. Select only the Name and Score columns selected_data &lt;- select(data, Name, Score) selected_data ## Name Score ## 1 John 85 ## 2 Jane 90 ## 3 David 88 ## 4 Anna 92 # 2. Filter rows where Score is greater than 88 filtered_data &lt;- filter(data, Score &gt; 88) filtered_data ## Name Age Score ## 1 Jane 34 90 ## 2 Anna 19 92 # 3. Add a new column that increases Score by 10 mutated_data &lt;- mutate(data, New_Score = Score + 10) mutated_data ## Name Age Score New_Score ## 1 John 28 85 95 ## 2 Jane 34 90 100 ## 3 David 22 88 98 ## 4 Anna 19 92 102 # 4. Calculate the average age summary_data &lt;- summarise(data, Average_Age = mean(Age)) summary_data ## Average_Age ## 1 25.75 In this example, we used functions from the dplyr package to select columns, filter rows, modify data, and summarize it! Key Takeaways: By learning about R package functions, you’ve unlocked even more tools to work efficiently in R. Here’s what you’ve learned today: How to install and load R packages. How to use package functions like those in dplyr for data manipulation. How to perform tasks like selecting columns, filtering data, and summarizing values. Packages in R allow you to extend the functionality of the base language for specific tasks. With packages, R becomes an even more powerful tool, allowing you to work with more advanced data sets and perform complex operations with ease! Practical Exercise In this exercise, you will use the functions from the dplyr package to manipulate the iris data set. Remember the dplyr package is installed by: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) and is loaded by: library(dplyr) The iris data set is loaded by data(&quot;iris&quot;) # view the first few columns head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Solve the following questions; Use the select function to select the Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, and Species columns.

Arguments are essential components of any function. Although it’s possible to write a function without parameters, like the example below, most functions do require arguments to tell them what data to process hello &lt;- function() { print(&#39;Hello, my friend&#39;) } Why Arguments Matter Arguments are the input for functions. They allow us to give the function specific values to work with. If we want a function to handle different cases or data, arguments give us that flexibility. When defining arguments, you include them inside the parentheses of the function definition, separated by commas. Generally, functions with more arguments tend to be more complex, but they also offer greater control over what the function does. # Creating a function with arguments my_function &lt;- function(argument1, argument2){ # function body } Handling Missing Arguments Whenever you create a function with parameters, you must provide the values for those parameters when calling the function. Otherwise, R will return an error. For example, if you forget to supply both numbers in a function to calculate their mean, the function won’t work. But you can avoid this issue by using default arguments. These are preset values that the function will use if you don’t provide them during the call. Let’s modify our mean function to demonstrate: mean_two_numbers &lt;- function(num_1, num_2 = 30) { mean &lt;- (num_1 + num_2) / 2 return (mean) } In this version, if you only provide one value when calling the function, R will automatically use the default value for the second number (which is 30 in this case): mean_two_numbers(num_1 = 10) ## [1] 20 You now understand how arguments work and the importance of default values in making functions more flexible and error-proof. Practical Exercise Create a function greet that prints a simple message like \"Hello, welcome to R programming!\". Write a function multiply_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the product of these numbers Create a function calculate_total that accepts two arguments, price and tax_rate. Set a default value of tax_rate = 0.15 (15%). Solution Create a function greet that prints a simple message like \"Hello, welcome to R programming!\". greet &lt;- function() { print(&quot;Hello, welcome to R programming!&quot;) } # Call the function greet() ## [1] &quot;Hello, welcome to R programming!&quot; Write a function multiply_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the product of these numbers. multiply_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a * b) } # Call the function multiply_numbers(6, 8) ## [1] 48 Create a function calculate_total that accepts two arguments, price and tax_rate. Set a default value of tax_rate = 0.15 (15%). calculate_total &lt;- function(price, tax_rate = 0.15) { total &lt;- price + (price * tax_rate) return(total) } # Call the function calculate_total(price=160) ## [1] 184 ________________________________________________________________________________ 2.1.5 Understanding Return Values in R Functions In many programming languages, functions take data as input and produce some result as output. Often, you must use a return statement to explicitly give back the result. Otherwise, the value might only be visible inside the function and not available to use later. But in R, the situation is a little more relaxed! In R, a function will always return a value that can be stored in a variable, even without a return statement. However, for clarity and good practice, it’s still helpful to include return to show your intent. Let’s walk through an example: mean_sum &lt;- function(num_1, num_2) { mean &lt;- (num_1 + num_2) / 2 sum &lt;- num_1 + num_2 return(list(mean = mean, sum = sum)) } Now, calling the function: results &lt;- mean_sum(10, 20) print(results) # You&#39;ll see both the mean and sum printed ## $mean ## [1] 15 ## ## $sum ## [1] 30 2.2 Calling the Functions In previous sections, we’ve seen how to call functions with different arguments. Now, let’s dig a little deeper into how R works behind the scenes when you pass arguments to a function. R allows two main ways of passing arguments: By position – The arguments are passed in the same order as the function definition. By name – You explicitly mention the argument name and its value. You can also mix these two strategies! Let’s explore these options using an example. Here’s a simple function that takes two arguments: name and surname. hello &lt;- function(name, surname) { print(paste(&#39;Hello&#39;, name, surname)) } Lets call the function using different strategies; By Position You pass the arguments in the exact order the function expects. hello(&#39;Jane&#39;, &#39;McCain&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello Jane McCain&quot; By Name When using this method, the order doesn’t matter. You just specify the argument names. hello(surname = &#39;McCain&#39;, name = &#39;Jane&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello Jane McCain&quot; Mixing Position and Name You can mix both approaches. Named arguments are matched first, then the remaining ones are matched by position hello(surname = &#39;McCain&#39;, &#39;Jane&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello Jane McCain&quot; This flexibility can make your code easier to read and maintain, especially when functions have many arguments! 2.3 Function Documentation Finally when writing functions, it’s always a good idea to provide documentation to guide users on how to use the function. This is especially important when dealing with complex functions or when the function is shared with others. One simple way to add documentation is by including comments in the body of your function. These comments explain what each part of the function does. This is an informal method, but it helps both you and others quickly understand what’s happening in the function. Here’s an example: hello &lt;- function(name, surname) { # Say hello to a person with their name and surname print(paste(&#39;Hello,&#39;, name, surname)) } If you call the function without executing it, you’ll see its structure along with the comments: hello ## function(name, surname) { ## # Say hello to a person with their name and surname ## print(paste(&#39;Hello,&#39;, name, surname)) ## } If your function is part of a larger package and you want it to be properly documented, you should write formal documentation in a separate .Rd file. These files store structured documentation, which you can access using ?function_name in R, similar to the help file you see for built-in functions like ?mean. Formal documentation includes details such as: Function name and description. Arguments and their roles. Examples of how to use the function. Output that the function returns. This approach ensures that users can easily understand and use your function, even in complex packages. 2.4 Hands-on Exercise You will attempt this hands-on exercise to confirm your understanding of functions. For one of the functions you created, add comments inside the function to explain what each part of the function does. Create a User-Defined Function (UDF) named calculate_area that takes two arguments: length and width. The function should return the area of a rectangle. Create a vector named values with the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Use the built-in sum() function to calculate the total of the values vector and print the result. Write a function named greet that takes one argument, student_name, and prints a greeting. Modify the function to have a default argument that greets a \"Student\" if no name is provided. Create a function named mean_and_median that takes a numeric vector as an argument and returns both the mean and median of that vector as a list. Solution Create a User-Defined Function (UDF) named calculate_area that takes two arguments: length and width. The function should return the area of a rectangle. calculate_area &lt;- function(length, width) { # Calculate the area by multiplying length and width area &lt;- length * width # Return the calculated area return(area) } # Example usage of the calculate_area function area_result &lt;- calculate_area(5, 10) # Length: 5, Width: 10 print(paste(&quot;Area of rectangle:&quot;, area_result)) ## [1] &quot;Area of rectangle: 50&quot; Create a vector named values with the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Use the built-in sum() function to calculate the total of the values vector and print the result. values &lt;- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) # Use the built-in sum() function to calculate the total of the values vector total &lt;- sum(values) # Print the result print(paste(&quot;Total of values vector:&quot;, total)) ## [1] &quot;Total of values vector: 108&quot; Write a function named greet that takes one argument, student_name, and prints a greeting. Modify the function to have a default argument that greets a \"Student\" if no name is provided. greet &lt;- function(student_name = &quot;Student&quot;) { # Print a greeting using the provided name or default to &quot;Student&quot; print(paste(&quot;Hello,&quot;, student_name)) } # Example usage of the greet function with a provided name greet(&quot;John&quot;) # Should print &quot;Hello, John&quot; ## [1] &quot;Hello, John&quot; # Example usage of the greet function without providing a name greet() ## [1] &quot;Hello, Student&quot; Create a function named mean_and_median that takes a numeric vector as an argument and returns both the mean and median of that vector as a list. mean_and_median &lt;- function(num_vector) { # Calculate the mean of the vector mean_value &lt;- mean(num_vector) # Calculate the median of the vector median_value &lt;- median(num_vector) # Return both mean and median as a list return(list(mean = mean_value, median = median_value)) } # Example usage of the mean_and_median function results &lt;- mean_and_median(c(12, 19, 21, 14, 09)) # Print the results print(paste(&quot;Mean:&quot;, results$mean, &quot;, Median:&quot;, results$median)) ## [1] &quot;Mean: 15 , Median: 14&quot; ________________________________________________________________________________ "],["group-manipulation.html", "Chapter 3 Group Manipulation 3.1 Apply Family 3.2 Aggregate Plyr 3.3 Data Reshaping", " Chapter 3 Group Manipulation Group manipulation in R refers to the process of grouping data based on certain categories and then performing operations based on each group separately. This is useful when you want to summarize, analyze or transform subsets of your data independently. In simple terms, group manipulation involves splitting the data into groups, applying a function to each group, and then combining the results. We will explore different methods designed by researchers for group manipulation. They are group manipulation using; The apply family, The aggregate from plyr package, Data reshaping 3.1 Apply Family The apply family in R is a collection of functions that helps you apply operations to data structures like vectors, lists, matrices and data frames in a more efficient way than using loops. Think of these functions as a way to give commands to your data in bulk, telling each piece what to do without repeating yourself. Let’s make this fun! Imagine you’re running a café, and you have tables (rows of data) with customer orders (columns of data). You want to calculate the total for each table or find out how much each customer spent on average. The apply family is like hiring a helper who goes to each table and collects information without you having to ask each customer individually! Lets have a quick overview of the members of the apply family; apply() - Works with matrices or data frames, applying a function to rows or columns. lapply() - Loops over elements in a list, applying a function to each element and returning a list. sapply() - Similar to lapply, but it returns a vector or matrix when possible. tapply() - Applies a function over subsets of data, especially useful for factors or groups. mapply() - Applies a function to multiple arguments simultaneously. Try it: Here is the apply family in action using the built-in R data set that contains information about flowers. Use apply to calculate the mean of each column in the iris data set at once(No need of specifying the columns) # Load and view the first few rows of the iris data set data(iris) head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa # Calculate the mean of each numeric column col_means &lt;- apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean) print(col_means) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 5.843333 3.057333 3.758000 1.199333 The 2 in apply means “apply the function to columns” and the mean was used to find the average of each column. This is simple as asking a helper to calculate the the average for all types of flowers for each characteristic (sepal length, petal length, etc.). Let’s repeat the same for a each row, instead of argument value 2 we will put argument value 1 in the second position. row_means &lt;- apply(iris[, 1:4], 1, mean) # Calculate the mean for each row head(row_means, 15) # Show the first fifteen averages of the row ## [1] 2.550 2.375 2.350 2.350 2.550 2.850 2.425 2.525 2.225 2.400 2.700 2.500 ## [13] 2.325 2.125 2.800 Now lets use the lapply function to find the range for each numeric column. This function applies to each element and returns a list. No need to specify if its a column or a row # Calculate the range of each numeric column in the iris dataset column_ranges &lt;- lapply(iris[, 1:4], range) print(column_ranges) ## $Sepal.Length ## [1] 4.3 7.9 ## ## $Sepal.Width ## [1] 2.0 4.4 ## ## $Petal.Length ## [1] 1.0 6.9 ## ## $Petal.Width ## [1] 0.1 2.5 Repeating the function with mean function instead of the range function. # Calculate the mean of each numeric column in the iris dataset col_means &lt;- lapply(iris[, 1:4], mean) print(col_means) ## $Sepal.Length ## [1] 5.843333 ## ## $Sepal.Width ## [1] 3.057333 ## ## $Petal.Length ## [1] 3.758 ## ## $Petal.Width ## [1] 1.199333 You see! lapply function works column wise instead of row wise when working with data frames. Lets create a function that will add 10 to the input value and use the lapply function to work on a vector. # Create a vector current_ages &lt;- c(21, 43, 12, 56, 32) # Create a function that adds 10 to an input value add_10 &lt;- function(value){ return(value + 10) } # Test the function add_10(27) ## [1] 37 # Apply the function to vector ages ages_10_years_later &lt;- lapply(current_ages, add_10) ages_10_years_later # Show the result ## [[1]] ## [1] 31 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 53 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 22 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 66 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 42 It returns a list with values in the vector current_ages add 10 to each value. The sapply() function works similarly to lapply(), but it tries to simplify the output. If possible, it will return a vector or matrix instead of a list. Let`s calculate the variance for each numeric column; # Calculate the variance for each numeric column col_variance &lt;- sapply(iris[, 1:4], var) print(col_variance) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 0.6856935 0.1899794 3.1162779 0.5810063 Remember that we created a function add_10 that adds 10 to the current ages of the clients. Lets repeat the same using the sapply function instead of lapply function. # Calculate the variance for each numeric column ages_10_years_later &lt;- sapply(current_ages, add_10) print(ages_10_years_later) ## [1] 31 53 22 66 42 It is now evident that sapply has a simpler output than the lapply function. The tapply() function applies a function to subsets of data grouped by a factor (e.g., species in our case). Let’s calculate the average sepal length for each species: # Calculate the average Sepal.Length for each Species avg_sepal_by_species &lt;- tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean) print(avg_sepal_by_species) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 5.006 5.936 6.588 This is like sending your helper to collect the sepal lengths for each species separately, and then calculating the average for each group. Finally the mapply() function is useful when you want to apply a function to multiple sets of arguments at once. Let’s calculate the sum of Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width for each row: # Sum Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width for each row sepal_sum &lt;- mapply(sum, iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width) head(sepal_sum) ## [1] 8.6 7.9 7.9 7.7 8.6 9.3 This function adds the sepal length and width for each flower row by row. It’s like your helper asking every customer for two values and summing them up together. Practical Exercise Now it’s time to test your skills! Use apply() to calculate the maximum for each column in the iris data set. Use lapply() to find the summary statistics (use the summary() function) for each numeric column in the iris data set. Use tapply() to find the average petal width for each species in the iris data set. Solution Use apply() to calculate the maximum for each column in the iris data set. max_values &lt;- apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, max) print(max_values) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 7.9 4.4 6.9 2.5 Use lapply() to find the summary statistics (use the summary() function) for each numeric column in the iris data set. sum_stats &lt;- lapply(iris[,1:4], summary) print(sum_stats) ## $Sepal.Length ## Min. 1st Qu.

This is similar to the SQL GROUP BY command or the tapply() that we have discussed above. The difference is that aggregate() allows to summarize data based on one or more grouping factors. Try it! Let’s explore an example using the built-in mtcars data set to show how to use the aggregate() from the plyr package. The plyr package can be installed by: install.packages(&quot;plyr&quot;) Lets start library(plyr) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ## You have loaded plyr after dplyr - this is likely to cause problems. ## If you need functions from both plyr and dplyr, please load plyr first, then dplyr: ## library(plyr); library(dplyr) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ## ## Attaching package: &#39;plyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise, ## summarize # Load the data set data(&quot;mtcars&quot;) # Use aggregate to find the average &#39;mpg&#39; (miles per gallon) grouped by the number of cylinders (&#39;cyl&#39;) avg_mpg_by_cyl &lt;- aggregate(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars, FUN = mean) avg_mpg_by_cyl ## cyl mpg ## 1 4 26.66364 ## 2 6 19.74286 ## 3 8 15.10000 If we break done the code; mpg ~ cyl tells R to calculate the average mpg(dependent variable) for each unique value of cyl(grouping factor). data = mtcars specifies the data set. FUN = mean applies the mean function to compute the average mpg for each group of cyl. We have just calculated the average mpg (miles per gallon) grouped by the number of cyl(cylinders). Let’s make it a little bit more complex by grouping with multiple variables and summarize multiple columns as well. We will calculate the mean horsepower(hp) and the weight(wt) by the number of cylinders(cyl) and the number of transmission(am). # Use aggregate to find the mean hp and wt by cylinders and transmission type avg_hp_wt_by_cyl_am &lt;- aggregate(cbind(hp, wt) ~ cyl + am, data = mtcars, FUN = mean) avg_hp_wt_by_cyl_am ## cyl am hp wt ## 1 4 0 84.66667 2.935000 ## 2 6 0 115.25000 3.388750 ## 3 8 0 194.16667 4.104083 ## 4 4 1 81.87500 2.042250 ## 5 6 1 131.66667 2.755000 ## 6 8 1 299.50000 3.370000 If we breakdown the code; cbind(hp, wt) allows you to summarize multiple columns (hp and wt). cyl + am groups the data by the number of cylinders and the transmission type (am = 0 for automatic, 1 for manual`). The argument FUN defines the function to be used here therefore, FUN = mean calculates the mean values for hp and wt for each group of cyl and am. Practical Exercise Try using the aggregate() with the iris data set to find the mean sepal length (Sepal.Length) and petal length(Petal.Length) for each species. Solution library(plyr) # Load the iris data set data(iris) # Calculate the averages as per the instructions avg_sepal_petal_by_species &lt;- aggregate(cbind(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length) ~ Species, data = iris, FUN = mean) avg_sepal_petal_by_species ## Species Sepal.Length Petal.Length ## 1 setosa 5.006 1.462 ## 2 versicolor 5.936 4.260 ## 3 virginica 6.588 5.552 ________________________________________________________________________________ 3.3 Data Reshaping Data reshaping is the process of transforming the layout or structure of a data set without changing the actual data. You typically reshape data to suit different analyses, visualizations, or reporting formats. Common operations for reshaping include pivoting data between wide and long formats. Wide format: Each subject(row) has its own columns for measurements at different time points or categories. Long format: The data has one measurement per row, making it easier to analyze in some cases, especially with repeated measures. In R, the most common function for reshaping data include; pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() from the tidyr package. melt() and dcast() from the reshape2 package. Try it! Let’s have some fun by working on the mtcars data set where we will demonstrate reshaping between wide and long formats Step 1: Inspect the Data The mtcars data set is already in a wide format where each row represents a car, and columns represent different variables for instance mpg, cyl, hp. data(mtcars) # Load the data set # First few records of the data set head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Step2: Converting from Wide to Long Format We will use the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package to convert the data set from wide to long format. In this case, we will shape the mpg, hp and wt columns into a longer format making it easier to work with. library(tidyr) # Reshape the data from wide to long format mtcars_long &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols=c(mpg, hp, wt), names_to = &quot;variable&quot;, values_to = &quot;value&quot;) # View the respaed data head(mtcars_long) ## # A tibble: 6 × 10 ## cyl disp drat qsec vs am gear carb variable value ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 6 160 3.9 16.5 0 1 4 4 mpg 21 ## 2 6 160 3.9 16.5 0 1 4 4 hp 110 ## 3 6 160 3.9 16.5 0 1 4 4 wt 2.62 ## 4 6 160 3.9 17.0 0 1 4 4 mpg 21 ## 5 6 160 3.9 17.0 0 1 4 4 hp 110 ## 6 6 160 3.9 17.0 0 1 4 4 wt 2.88 If we break down the code; pivot_longer() function moves the selected columns (mpg, hp, wt) into a new “long” format, with eah row representing a unique combination of car characteristics(variable) and their corresponding value. names_to = \"variable\": The variable names (e.g., mpg, hp, wt) are moved to a column named “variable”. values_to = \"value\": The data for each variable is placed in a column named \"value\". Also, data in long format can be converted to a wide format. The pivot_wider function from dplyr gets the work done. Try it! Lets put the pivot_wider function into practice. We will convert the ntcars_long data set that we just recently generated to a wider format. # Reshape from long to wide format mtcars_wide &lt;- mtcars_long %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;variable&quot;, values_from = &quot;value&quot;) # View the reshaped data head(mtcars_wide) ## # A tibble: 6 × 11 ## cyl disp drat qsec vs am gear carb mpg hp wt ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 6 160 3.9 16.5 0 1 4 4 21 110 2.62 ## 2 6 160 3.9 17.0 0 1 4 4 21 110 2.88 ## 3 4 108 3.85 18.6 1 1 4 1 22.8 93 2.32 ## 4 6 258 3.08 19.4 1 0 3 1 21.4 110 3.22 ## 5 8 360 3.15 17.0 0 0 3 2 18.7 175 3.44 ## 6 6 225 2.76 20.2 1 0 3 1 18.1 105 3.46 If we break down the code; pivot_wider() converts the long format back into the wide format, with separate columns for each variable (mpg, hp, wt). names_from = \"variable\": Moves the unique values from the \"variable” column into their own columns (e.g., mpg, hp, wt). values_from = \"value\": Populates the new columns with values from the “value” column. Practical Exercise Use the pivot_longer() function to convert the iris dataset (which contains measurements for different flower features) into a long format. Focus on converting the numeric columns like Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width. Then, use pivot_wider() to convert it back to a wide format.

Measuring central tendency summarizes the data by identifying skewness, distribution and how the data is robust to outliers. Business calculate the central tendencies like average sales, median customer age to make informed decision-making. Here are some of the statistical concepts used to define central tendecy and spread; Mean Mode Quartiles(Median, upper and lower quartile) Range and IQR Variance and standard deviation a.Arithmetic mean It is also referred to as the average. It is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in the set. R has a function mean to calculate the average. Here is the formula for mean; \\[\\overline{x} ={ \\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_i\\over{n}}\\] Where; \\(\\overline{x}\\) is the mean \\(x_i\\) represent value at position \\(i\\) \\(n\\) is the number(count) of values in a set Lets calculate the average net amount spent on the ecommerce store. # Calculate the mean net amount mean(ecommerce$Net.Amount) ## [1] 2875.95 The average amount spent on the e-commerce store by all the customers was 2875.95 INR. Mode The mode shows the most frequent value, thereby pinpoint the most popular categories in a data set. In the commerce data set we will find the most popular category and age group in the data set. Find the most popular category # Calculate the mode for &#39;ProductCategory&#39; table(ecommerce$Product.Category) ## ## Beauty and Health Books Clothing Electronics ## 8332 2762 10968 16574 ## Home &amp; Kitchen Other Pet Care Sports &amp; Fitness ## 5489 2171 1618 5557 ## Toys &amp; Games ## 1529 which.max(table(ecommerce$Product.Category)) ## Electronics ## 4 Quartiles ____Come back later_____ Range To understand range, we will define, maximum and maximum values. The maximum value is the largest value in a set while the minimum is the smallest value in a set. Range is the difference between the maximum(largest value) and the minimum value in a set. Here is a formula for range; \\[Range = Max - Min\\] Lets create a vector ages that defines the ages of different customers on a retail stores, find the maximum and minimum ages then calculate the range. # Create vector ages ages &lt;- c(21, 27, 55, 13, 87, 51, 33, 64) # Find the maximum max(ages) ## [1] 87 # Find the minimum min(ages) ## [1] 13 # Calculate the range diff(range(ages)) ## [1] 74 Try it! Now its clear what range, lets get into the real-world scenario. We will find the maximum and minimum Gross.Amount spent on the ecommerce store. Finally, we calculate the range of amount spent by customers(Gross.Amount) # Maximum amount spent by customers max(ecommerce$Gross.Amount) ## [1] 8394.826 # Minimum amount spent by customers min(ecommerce$Gross.Amount) ## [1] 136.4543 # Range diff(range(ecommerce$Gross.Amount)) ## [1] 8258.371 Standard deviation and Variance Variance is statistical measure of dispersion that defines how spread the data points are in a data set in relation to the mean of the data set. Standard deviation is the measure of how data is clustered around the mean. It is simply defined to as the square root of variance. Here is the formula of variance; \\[\\sigma = {\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2 \\over{n}}\\] Where; \\(\\sigma\\) is the variance \\(x_i\\) is the value \\(\\overline{x}\\) is the population mean \\(n\\) is the value count Standard is simply the square root of variance, Here is the formula for standard deviation; \\[S = \\sqrt{\\sigma}\\] or \\[S = \\sqrt{{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2 \\over{n}}}\\] Where \\(S\\) is the standard deviation. Variance and standard deviation can be calculated in R environment using var() and sd() functions respectively. Lets create a vector of weights of the athletes in kilograms and calculate the variance and standard deviation. # Sample vector athlete_weights = c(55, 76, 52, 68, 71, 63, 58, 52, 85, 96) # Calculate variance var(athlete_weights) ## [1] 216.7111 # Calculate the standard deviation sd(athlete_weights) ## [1] 14.72111 Lets put into real world practice and calculate variance and standard deviation of net amount spent on the ecommerce store. # Variance var(ecommerce$Net.Amount) ## [1] 2979517 # Standard deviation sd(ecommerce$Net.Amount) ## [1] 1726.128 Practical Exercise Solution ________________________________________________________________________________ 4.2 Data Visualization Data visualization is the process of using visual elements like chart, graphs or maps to represent data in a way that is easier to understand. Luckily, R has a package, ggplot2, specifically designed to create charts and graphs. The package is said to implement the “Grammar of Graphics” that is a conceptual framework for creating graphs by Leland Wilkinson. The package can be installed by; install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) and once the package is installed it is loaded by; library(ggplot2) "],["simple-linear-regression.html", "Chapter 5 Simple Linear Regression 5.1 Basics of Wilkinson-Rogers Notation (y ~ x), Linear Regression 5.2 Scatterplots with Regression Lines, Reading lm() Output 5.3 Confidence Intervals for Regression Coefficients, Testing Coefficients 5.4 Identifying Points in a Plot", " Chapter 5 Simple Linear Regression Welcome to the world of Simple Linear Regression! 🎉 This statistical technique is super handy when you want to explore the relationship between two continuous variables. Essentially, it helps us predict the value of one variable based on the value of another. For example, imagine you want to predict a student’s exam score based on the number of hours they studied. Here, the hours studied are the independent variable (or predictor), and the exam score is the dependent variable (or response). What is Simple Linear Regression? In simple linear regression, we fit a straight line (called the regression line) through the data points. This line is defined by the equation: \\[y = mx + b\\] Where: \\(y\\) is the predicted value (dependent variable). \\(m\\) is the slope of the line (how much \\(y\\) changes for a unit change in \\(x\\)). \\(x\\) is the independent variable. \\(b\\) is the y-intercept (the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is 0). Let’s use the built-in mtcars data set in R to demonstrate how to perform simple linear regression.

Imagine trying to recreate someone’s analysis only to find that you get different results or that they left out crucial steps. Frustrating, right? Reproducibility is the answer—it means you can get the same results every time by following the same steps. Why Reproducibility Matters Trustworthiness: When your results can be replicated, others can trust your analysis. Error Detection: Re-running the same code helps catch mistakes early. Efficiency: With reproducible scripts, you save time if you need to redo parts of your analysis. 6.1 Key Tools in R for Reproducibility and Reporting Let’s dive into the tools that make reproducibility and reporting a breeze in R: R Markdown: This is the gold standard for reproducible reports in R. You can write code, comments, and format it all beautifully in one document. Think of it as combining your code with a notebook-style narrative. Interactive Demo: Create an R Markdown file in RStudio by clicking File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown…. You can add headers, code chunks, and text. Run Your Code: Run each chunk individually, or click Knit to create a fully formatted report with all your code and outputs embedded. Find here more resources on R markdown. ________remember the resources_______ Setting a Seed fr Consistency: R’s random number generator can be controlled with set.seed(). For instance; set.seed(42) sample(1:100, 5) ## [1] 49 65 25 74 18 This will always produce the same random sample, making your analysis consistent. Code Commenting and Documentation: Clear comments make your analysis easy to understand for others and for yourself. Use comments (#) in your code to describe steps, and include documentation for more complex functions. Below is an example of a comment. # This is a comment 6.2 Creating Reproducible Reports Let’s walk through a simple activity where we create a reproducible report: Set Up Your R Markdown File Open RStudio and create a new R Markdown file.

Solution ________________________________________________________________________________ "],["r-shiny.html", "Chapter 7 R Shiny 7.1 Structure of a Shiny App", " Chapter 7 R Shiny Shiny is a fantastic R package that allows you to easily create interactive web applications (or “apps”) directly from R. In this lesson, we’ll dive right into how to start building Shiny apps. First things first, if you haven’t installed the Shiny package yet, simply open R, make sure you’re connected to the internet, and run the following command: install.packages(&quot;shiny&quot;) Shiny also integrates with another package called bslib, which helps in creating visually appealing user interfaces (UIs). To explore more about it, you can check out its documentation here. Here is an example of an R shiny app The Shiny package comes with several pre-built examples that showcase how Shiny works in action. Each example is a fully functional Shiny app. The Hello Shiny example, for instance, generates a histogram using R’s faithful data set. The histogram’s bin count can be adjusted by the user through a slider, and the app instantly updates based on their selection. This example is perfect for learning the basics of Shiny app structure and building your very first app. To try it out, just run the following commands in R: library(shiny) runExample(&quot;01_hello&quot;) 7.1 Structure of a Shiny App Shiny apps are typically organized in a single script called app.R, which resides in a designated folder (for example, newdir/). You can run the app by executing runApp(\"newdir\"). The app.R file consists of three main components: A User Interface Object A Server Function A Call to the shinyApp Function 7.1.1 User Interface(ui) The user interface (ui) object defines the layout and visual aspects of your app. Below is the ui object used in the Hello Shiny example: library(shiny) library(bslib) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;bslib&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:utils&#39;: ## ## page # Define UI for app that draws a histogram ---- ui &lt;- page_sidebar( # App title ---- title = &quot;Hello Shiny!&quot;, # Sidebar panel for inputs ---- sidebar = sidebar( # Input: Slider for the number of bins ---- sliderInput( inputId = &quot;bins&quot;, label = &quot;Number of bins:&quot;, min = 1, max = 50, value = 30 ) ), # Output: Histogram ---- plotOutput(outputId = &quot;distPlot&quot;) ) 7.1.2 Server Here i the server function for the Hello Shiny Example: # Define server logic required to draw a histogram ---- server &lt;- function(input, output) { # Histogram of the Old Faithful Geyser Data ---- # with requested number of bins # This expression that generates a histogram is wrapped in a call # to renderPlot to indicate that: # # 1. It is &quot;reactive&quot; and should automatically # re-execute when inputs (input$bins) change # 2. Its output type is a plot output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({ x &lt;- faithful$waiting bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1) hist(x, breaks = bins, col = &quot;#007bc2&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;, xlab = &quot;Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of waiting times&quot;) }) } At its core, the server function in the Hello Shiny example is quite straightforward. It performs some calculations and generates a histogram based on the specified number of bins. However, you’ll notice that most of the script is wrapped in a call to renderPlot. The comment above the function provides some explanation, but don’t worry if it seems unclear; we will explore this concept in greater detail later. Before you start experimenting with the Hello Shiny app and reviewing its source code, remember that your app.R file should begin with loading the Shiny package and conclude with a call to shinyApp: library(shiny) # See above for the definitions of ui and server ui &lt;- ... server &lt;- ... shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) While the Hello Shiny app is running, your R session will be occupied and won’t accept other commands. R is actively monitoring the app and processing its reactions. To regain access to your R session, press the escape key or click the stop icon located in the upper right corner of the RStudio console panel. How that you have known how to create an RShiny app, lets create a simple temperature converter that will convert temperature from Celcius to Farenheit. library(shiny) # Define UI for the Temperature Converter app ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;Temperature Converter&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( numericInput(&quot;temp_input&quot;, &quot;Temperature:&quot;, value = 0), selectInput(&quot;temp_scale&quot;, &quot;Select scale:&quot;, choices = c(&quot;Celsius to Fahrenheit&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit to Celsius&quot;)), actionButton(&quot;convert&quot;, &quot;Convert&quot;) ), mainPanel( textOutput(&quot;result&quot;) ) ) ) # Define server logic for the Temperature Converter server &lt;- function(input, output) { observeEvent(input$convert, { if (input$temp_scale == &quot;Celsius to Fahrenheit&quot;) { result &lt;- (input$temp_input * 9/5) + 32 output$result &lt;- renderText({ paste(input$temp_input, &quot;°C =&quot;, round(result, 2), &quot;°F&quot;) }) } else { result &lt;- (input$temp_input - 32) * 5/9 output$result &lt;- renderText({ paste(input$temp_input, &quot;°F =&quot;, round(result, 2), &quot;°C&quot;) }) } }) } # Run the app shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) Practical Exercise "],["building-r-packages.html", "Chapter 8 Building R Packages", " Chapter 8 Building R Packages "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
