Think of them as reusable instructions that you can call whenever you need them. Here’s why functions are super helpful: Avoid repetition: Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can just call the function. Cleaner code: Your code becomes easier to read and maintain because functions help organize it better. Easier debugging: When something goes wrong, you only need to check the function itself rather than searching through your entire program. Why Use Functions? Imagine having to rewrite a set of instructions every time you need them! With functions, you write the code once and reuse it as many times as you want. A good rule of thumb is: if you expect to run a specific set of instructions more than twice, create a function for it. What Can Functions Do? Functions are flexible and can be used for many different purposes: Take input (called arguments) Process the input based on what the function is meant to do Return a result after completing the task 2.1 Writing Functions Lets take a tour on different types of functions in R before diving deep into writing functions. This will help you understand when to write functions and when to use readily-available functions. There are three main types of functions: User-Defined Functions (UDF) – Custom functions you write for your specific needs. Built-in functions – These come pre-loaded in R. Example: mean() Package functions – Functions from external R packages you can install. Example: ggplot() and select() from ggplot2 and dplyr respectively. 2.1.1 User-Defined Functions The best way to grasp how functions work in R is by creating your own! These are called* User-Defined Functions (UDFs), and they allow you to design custom tasks that fit your needs. In R, functions typically follow this format: function_name &lt;- function(argument_1, argument_2) { # Function body (your instructions go here) return(output) } Let’s break down the key elements: Function Name: This is how you’ll call your function later. When you create a function, you assign it a name and save it as a new object. For example, if you name your function calculate_mean, that’s the name you’ll use every time you want to run the function. Arguments (also called Parameters): Arguments are placed inside the parentheses. They tell the function what input to expect or how to modify its behavior. Think of them as placeholders for the data you’ll provide later when you run the function. Function Body: Inside the curly brackets {}, you’ll write the instructions that the function will follow to accomplish the task. This is the “heart” of the function. Return Statement: The return() function tells R what result to give you after the function finishes its job. It’s optional, but it helps if you want to store the function’s result in a variable. Let’s write a simple function that calculates the mean (average) of two numbers: mean_two_numbers &lt;- function(num_1, num_2) { mean &lt;- (num_1 + num_2) / 2 return(mean) } How to Use the Function: To find the mean of 10 and 20, simply call the function like this: mean_two_numbers(10, 20) ## [1] 15 Let’s add a few more simple tasks: writing a function that calculates the difference between two numbers. Why is this important? Well, imagine you have two values and you want to find their difference—that’s exactly what this function will help us do! # Function to calculate the difference between two numbers calculate_difference &lt;- function(x, y) { # Subtract the second number (y) from the first number (x) difference &lt;- x - y # Return the difference result so we can use it later return(difference) } You see!: x and y are our arguments: These are the two numbers we’ll use in our calculation. The subtraction happens inside the function: We simply subtract y from x and store the result in difference. Finally, we return the difference: This way, we can use the result when we call the function. Now, let’s put it to the test! We’ll run the function with different sets of numbers and see what we get: calculate_difference(10, 5) # 10 - 5 = 5 ## [1] 5 calculate_difference(25, 15) # 25 - 15 = 10 ## [1] 10 calculate_difference(50, 30) # 50 - 30 = 20 ## [1] 20 Notice how easy it is to calculate the difference between any two numbers by just calling our function? That’s the power of writing your own functions—they make life a lot easier! Now, lets make it more interesting! How about a function that greets you by name? We can do the same in R by creating a simple function that takes someone’s name and returns a greeting. Here is how we do it: # Function to greet a student by their name greet_student &lt;- function(student_name) { # Create a personalized greeting greeting &lt;- paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, student_name, &quot;!&quot;) # Return the greeting so we can use it later return(greeting) } Remember! We use student_name as the argument: This is where you pass in the name of the student. We combine \"Hello\" with the name: The paste() function(that is an -in-built function which will discuss later in the course) helps us put the pieces together to form a full sentence. Return the greeting: The function gives us back a customized message, ready to greet anyone! Lets try it out with different names greet_student(&quot;John&quot;) # Hello John! ## [1] &quot;Hello John !&quot; greet_student(&quot;Alice&quot;) # Hello Alice! ## [1] &quot;Hello Alice !&quot; greet_student(&quot;Michael&quot;) # Hello Michael! ## [1] &quot;Hello Michael !&quot; Remember to try it out with your name! Key Takeaways: By writing these two simple functions, you’ve already tackled a lot of important concepts in R! You now know: How to create a function. How to pass arguments (inputs/parameters) to a function. How to return a result that you can use later. Practical Exercise In this exercise, you’ll get hands-on practice creating your own functions in R. Follow the instructions below to write functions that perform specific tasks. Remember to test your functions with different input values! Create a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. Write a function named is_even that takes a single argument, num, and returns \"Even\" if the number is even, or \"Odd\" if it’s odd. Create a function called find_max that takes three arguments and returns the largest of the three numbers. Solution Create a function called add_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. # Function to calculate the sum of two numbers sum_two_numbers &lt;- function(x, y) { sum &lt;- x + y return(sum) } # Test the function with different values sum_two_numbers(5, 10) # Output: 15 ## [1] 15 sum_two_numbers(20, 30) # Output: 50 ## [1] 50 sum_two_numbers(100, 200) # Output: 300 ## [1] 300 Write a function named is_even that takes a single argument, num, and returns \"Even\" if the number is even, or \"Odd\" if it’s odd. # Function to check if a number is even or odd check_even_odd &lt;- function(number) { if (number %% 2 == 0) { return(&quot;Even&quot;) } else { return(&quot;Odd&quot;) } } # Test the function with different numbers check_even_odd(4) # Output: &quot;Even&quot; ## [1] &quot;Even&quot; check_even_odd(7) # Output: &quot;Odd&quot; ## [1] &quot;Odd&quot; check_even_odd(10) # Output: &quot;Even&quot; ## [1] &quot;Even&quot; Create a function called find_max that takes three arguments and returns the largest of the three numbers. # Function to find the maximum of three numbers max_of_three &lt;- function(a, b, c) { max_value &lt;- max(a, b, c) # Use the built-in max function return(max_value) # Return the maximum value } # Test the function with different values max_of_three(10, 20, 5) # Output: 20 ## [1] 20 max_of_three(3, 1, 2) # Output: 3 ## [1] 3 max_of_three(7, 15, 12) # Output: 15 ## [1] 15 ________________________________________________________________________________ 2.1.2 Built-in Fuctions We have learned how to create our own user-defined functions (UDFs) to perform specific tasks. Now, let’s dive deeper into R’s capabilities by exploring its built-in functions. These handy tools are readily available for you to use anytime, making your coding experience even smoother. R is packed with a treasure trove of built-in functions that allow you to perform a variety of tasks with just a few simple commands. Whether you’re crunching numbers or analyzing data, these functions are your best friends. Here’s a sneak peek at some of the most useful built-in functions in R: print(): This function displays an R object right on your console. It’s like saying, “Hey, look at this!” print(&quot;Hello Mum&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello Mum&quot; min() and max(): Need to find the smallest or largest number in a bunch? These functions will do just that for a numeric vector. sum(): Want to add up a series of numbers? Use sum() to get the total of a numeric vector. mean(): This function calculates the average of your numbers. Perfect for when you need to find the middle ground! range(): Curious about the minimum and maximum values of your numeric vector? range() has you covered. str(): Want to understand the structure of an R object? str() will give you a clear picture of what’s inside. ncol(): If you’re working with matrices or data frames, this function tells you how many columns you have. length(): This one returns the number of items in an R object, whether it’s a vector, a list, or a matrix. Here’s a quick example to show you how easy it is to use these functions with a vector of numbers: v &lt;- c(1, 3, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7) # Create a vector print(v) # Display the vector ## [1] 1.0 3.0 0.2 1.5 1.7 sum(v) # Calculate the total sum ## [1] 7.4 mean(v) # Find the average ## [1] 1.48 length(v) # Get the number of elements ## [1] 5 As you can see, working with R’s built-in functions is straightforward and super helpful. Start experimenting with these functions and watch how they can simplify your coding experience! Key Takeaways: By completing this exercise, you’ve already tackled several important concepts in R! You now know: How to create a vector and use it for calculations. How to utilize built-in functions like sum(), max(), min(), mean(), and length(). How to derive meaningful statistics from data using R’s built-in capabilities R has a wealth of resources on this topic, and as you gain more experience and knowledge, you’ll uncover even more advanced built-in functions that can simplify your programming tasks. Practical Exercise In this exercise, you are required to create a vector named numbers that contains the following values: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. After creating the vector, you will use various built-in functions to analyze it based on the instructions below; Use the sum() function to calculate the total of the numbers vector. Use the max() function to find the maximum value in the numbers vector. Use the min() function to find the minimum value in the numbers vector. Use the mean() function to calculate the average of the numbers vector. Use the length() function to find out how many elements are in your numbers vector. Solution In this exercise, you are required to create a vector named numbers that contains the following values: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. After creating the vector, you will use various built-in functions to analyze it based on the instructions below; # Create a vector numbers &lt;- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) Use the sum() function to calculate the total of the numbers vector. sum(numbers) ## [1] 108 Use the max() function to find the maximum value in the numbers vector. max(numbers) ## [1] 42 Use the min() function to find the minimum value in the numbers vector. min(numbers) ## [1] 4 Use the mean() function to calculate the average of the numbers vector. mean(numbers) ## [1] 18 Use the length() function to find out how many elements are in your numbers vector. length(numbers) ## [1] 6 ________________________________________________________________________________ 2.1.3 Package Functions Just like we’ve learned about User-Defined and Built-in Functions, R also provides a vast number of additional functions through packages. These packages extend R’s capabilities and allow you to perform specific tasks, from data manipulation to machine learning, with ease. What are R Package Functions? Packages in R are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code that are stored in a well-defined format. While R comes with a set of built-in functions, packages allow you to go beyond the basic functionality. You can install and load packages based on the task you want to accomplish. Think of package functions as tools in a toolbox: not everything is built-in, but by adding specific tools, you can perform new tasks easily. Lets explore how to get started using the functions; Installing and Loading Packages To use functions from a package, you first need to install the package and load it into your R session. install.packages(&quot;package_name&quot;) Every time you start a new R session if you want to use the functions from that package. Load the package by; library(package_name) To put this into real-life action, let’s learn about the dplyr package, which is commonly used for data manipulation. It contains many useful functions to work with data frames or tibbles (a modern version of data frames). Here’s an example of how to install and load dplyr, and use some of its core functions. Install the package install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) # Install it once Load the package library(dplyr) # Load it whenever you need to use it ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union Let’s explore a few package functions from dplyr: select(): Chooses specific columns from a dataset. filter(): Filters rows based on conditions. mutate(): Adds new variables (columns) or modifies existing ones. summarise(): Summarizes data, such as calculating the mean or total We will create a data frame to demonstrate how to use functions from the dplyr package. # Create a data frame for demonstration data &lt;- data.frame( Name = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;), Age = c(28, 34, 22, 19), Score = c(85, 90, 88, 92) ) # 1. Select only the Name and Score columns selected_data &lt;- select(data, Name, Score) selected_data ## Name Score ## 1 John 85 ## 2 Jane 90 ## 3 David 88 ## 4 Anna 92 # 2. Filter rows where Score is greater than 88 filtered_data &lt;- filter(data, Score &gt; 88) filtered_data ## Name Age Score ## 1 Jane 34 90 ## 2 Anna 19 92 # 3. Add a new column that increases Score by 10 mutated_data &lt;- mutate(data, New_Score = Score + 10) mutated_data ## Name Age Score New_Score ## 1 John 28 85 95 ## 2 Jane 34 90 100 ## 3 David 22 88 98 ## 4 Anna 19 92 102 # 4. Calculate the average age summary_data &lt;- summarise(data, Average_Age = mean(Age)) summary_data ## Average_Age ## 1 25.75 In this example, we used functions from the dplyr package to select columns, filter rows, modify data, and summarize it! Key Takeaways: By learning about R package functions, you’ve unlocked even more tools to work efficiently in R. Here’s what you’ve learned today: How to install and load R packages. How to use package functions like those in dplyr for data manipulation. How to perform tasks like selecting columns, filtering data, and summarizing values. Packages in R allow you to extend the functionality of the base language for specific tasks. With packages, R becomes an even more powerful tool, allowing you to work with more advanced data sets and perform complex operations with ease! Practical Exercise In this exercise, you will use the functions from the dplyr package to manipulate the iris data set. Remember the dplyr package is installed by: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) and is loaded by: library(dplyr) The iris data set is loaded by data(&quot;iris&quot;) # view the first few columns head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Solve the following questions; Use the select function to select the Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, and Species columns. Use the filter function to filter rows where Sepal.Length is greater than 5. Use the mutate function to create a new column Sepal.Ratio that divides Sepal.Length by Sepal.Width. Solution In this exercise, you will use the functions from the dplyr package to manipulate the iris data set. Remember the dplyr package is installed by: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) and is loaded by: library(dplyr) The iris data set is loaded by data(&quot;iris&quot;) # view the first few columns head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Solve the following questions; Use the select function to select the Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, and Species columns. selected_iris &lt;- select(iris, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Species) head(selected_iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 setosa Use the filter function to filter rows where Sepal.Length is greater than 5. filtered_iris &lt;- filter(iris, Sepal.Length&gt;5) head(filtered_iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 3 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 4 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa Use the mutate function to create a new column Sepal.Ratio that divides Sepal.Length by Sepal.Width. updated_iris &lt;- mutate(iris, Sepal.Ratio=Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width) head(updated_iris$Sepal.Ratio) ## [1] 1.457143 1.633333 1.468750 1.483871 1.388889 1.384615 ________________________________________________________________________________ 2.1.4 Type of arguments in R functions Now that we’ve learned and explored different types of functions, let’s dive into function arguments to strengthen your understanding of writing functions. Arguments are essential components of any function. Although it’s possible to write a function without parameters, like the example below, most functions do require arguments to tell them what data to process hello &lt;- function() { print(&#39;Hello, my friend&#39;) } Why Arguments Matter Arguments are the input for functions. They allow us to give the function specific values to work with. If we want a function to handle different cases or data, arguments give us that flexibility. When defining arguments, you include them inside the parentheses of the function definition, separated by commas. Generally, functions with more arguments tend to be more complex, but they also offer greater control over what the function does. # Creating a function with arguments my_function &lt;- function(argument1, argument2){ # function body } Handling Missing Arguments Whenever you create a function with parameters, you must provide the values for those parameters when calling the function. Otherwise, R will return an error. For example, if you forget to supply both numbers in a function to calculate their mean, the function won’t work. But you can avoid this issue by using default arguments. These are preset values that the function will use if you don’t provide them during the call. Let’s modify our mean function to demonstrate: mean_two_numbers &lt;- function(num_1, num_2 = 30) { mean &lt;- (num_1 + num_2) / 2 return (mean) } In this version, if you only provide one value when calling the function, R will automatically use the default value for the second number (which is 30 in this case): mean_two_numbers(num_1 = 10) ## [1] 20 You now understand how arguments work and the importance of default values in making functions more flexible and error-proof. Practical Exercise Create a function greet that prints a simple message like \"Hello, welcome to R programming!\". Write a function multiply_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the product of these numbers Create a function calculate_total that accepts two arguments, price and tax_rate. Set a default value of tax_rate = 0.15 (15%). Solution Create a function greet that prints a simple message like \"Hello, welcome to R programming!\". greet &lt;- function() { print(&quot;Hello, welcome to R programming!&quot;) } # Call the function greet() ## [1] &quot;Hello, welcome to R programming!&quot; Write a function multiply_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the product of these numbers. multiply_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a * b) } # Call the function multiply_numbers(6, 8) ## [1] 48 Create a function calculate_total that accepts two arguments, price and tax_rate. Set a default value of tax_rate = 0.15 (15%). calculate_total &lt;- function(price, tax_rate = 0.15) { total &lt;- price + (price * tax_rate) return(total) } # Call the function calculate_total(price=160) ## [1] 184 ________________________________________________________________________________ "],["group-manipulation.html", "Chapter 3 Group Manipulation", " Chapter 3 Group Manipulation "],["general-statistics.html", "Chapter 4 General Statistics", " Chapter 4 General Statistics "],["simple-linear-regression.html", "Chapter 5 Simple Linear Regression", " Chapter 5 Simple Linear Regression "],["reproducibility-and-report-with-r-markdown.html", "Chapter 6 Reproducibility and Report with R Markdown", " Chapter 6 Reproducibility and Report with R Markdown "],["r-shiny-building-r-packages.html", "Chapter 7 R Shiny, Building R Packages", " Chapter 7 R Shiny, Building R Packages "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
